# Ajio-Clone
This repository contains a frontend replica of the popular e-commerce platform, Ajio. The purpose of this project is to showcase my skills in web development and user interface design.

Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I have recreated the key features and visual elements of Ajio's frontend.This include the homepage layout.The design closely resembles the original Ajio website, with attention to detail and responsiveness for different devices.

Please note that this is solely a frontend replica, meaning that it does not include any backend functionality or real-time data integration. It serves as a demonstration of my ability to replicate complex user interfaces and create interactive web experiences.
